A Game of Thrones takes place on the fictional continent of Westeros, which experiences years-long seasons of varying intensity. The majority of Westeros comprises the Seven Kingdoms, and a monumental wall of ice separates the northernmost portion of the continent from the frigid wasteland beyond. In the Prologue, a group of men from the Night’s Watch—the ancient but derelict organization that guards the Wall—track a group of “wildling” people who live beyond the boundaries of the realm. Pale, blue-eyed wights kill most of their party.
